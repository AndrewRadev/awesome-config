Adapted from the original configs, as everything else out there, with some level of customization. For instance:

- Modifier key is `Alt`, not the default Windows button.
- Only two layouts -- fullscreen and horizontal tile.
- There's a custom `map_global` function that allows me to write down keybindings Vim-style (like `M-S-j`), making it easier for me to read and update them.
- Some helpful functions in the `lib` directory.

Widget libraries checked out as submodules:
